## Morning Briefing — Research Email Integration
- Added SEB/Bloomberg research email scanning to morning briefing pipeline
- Prefetch (06:55): searches `from:knut.greiner@seb.no OR from:*bloomberg*`, reads full bodies
- Briefing (07:00): produces ONE consolidated exec summary across all research emails — not per-email
- Moved briefing from 08:00→07:00, prefetch from 07:55→06:55
- Knut set up auto-forward from knut.greiner@seb.no to banna@bottenanna.no
