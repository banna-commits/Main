# 2026-02-26 (Thursday)

## 00:24 heartbeat
- Calendar sweep (primary + AutoCalendar) covering next 48h; primary empty, AutoCalendar shows the carnival + lavvo all-day blocks already logged, nothing actionable within 2h so no alert sent during quiet hours

## 00:51 heartbeat
- Quiet-hours email sweep (`newer_than:2h is:unread`) came up empty; no new alerts beyond last night's Bloomberg/OpenAI traffic

## 01:23 heartbeat
- Calendar sweep (primary + AutoCalendar) again; primary still empty, AutoCalendar only shows the already-logged carnival/lavvo all-day events so no new alerts sent

## 02:02 heartbeat
- Quiet-hours email sweep (`newer_than:2h is:unread`) came back empty; inbox unchanged since earlier alerts, so no outreach needed

## 02:07 heartbeat
- Calendar sweep (primary + AutoCalendar) covering next 48h; primary still blank, AutoCalendar only shows the ongoing carnival/lavvo all-day blocks already logged
