## Mission Control → Next.js Migration
- Migrated taskboard.html (701 lines) to Next.js 15 app at `mission-control/`
- Stack: Next.js 16.1.6 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + App Router
- Sub-agent timed out after 5m but created project, API routes, types, 5/6 components
- Finished MemoryTab + page.tsx wiring manually
- Build passes clean (`npm run build` ✓)
- Node v24 issue: Next.js says "Ready" but never listens — had to install Node v22 via fnm
- Actually the node version wasn't the issue — OpenClaw exec sandbox kills child processes
- Solution: `nohup` for manual runs, launchd for persistence
- Launchd service: `com.openclaw.missioncontrol` on port 3000
- Updated Chrome bookmark to point to localhost:3000

## Melissa's Birthday Reminder
- Sent Telegram reminder about Melissa's birthday (Feb 23)
- Knut confirmed flowers already ordered
- Added "🎂 Melissas bursdag" to AutoCalendar for Feb 23

## Gmail OAuth Expired
- `gog gmail search` returns "Token has been expired or revoked"
- Needs re-auth: `gog auth add bottenanna26@gmail.com --services gmail,calendar,...`
- Requires Knut's browser for OAuth consent
