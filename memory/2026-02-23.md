## Mission Control — Tailscale Serve
- Exposed Mission Control (localhost:3000) via Tailscale serve (internal tailnet only, no Funnel)
- URL: https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail74a1a0.ts.net/
- Accessible from all devices on Knut's tailnet
- Command: `tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- To disable: `tailscale serve --https=443 off`

## Mission Control — Port Change
- Moved Mission Control from port 3000 to 3001 to avoid conflicting with OpenClaw dashboard
- Tailscale serve: own HTTPS port `:3001` instead of subpath `/mc` (Tailscale strips path prefix, breaks SPAs)
- Updated: package.json, launchd plist, Tailscale serve config
- OpenClaw dashboard: `https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail74a1a0.ts.net/` (port 18789)
- Mission Control: `https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail74a1a0.ts.net:3001`
