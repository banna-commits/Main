# 2026-02-18 — Daily Log

## Telegram Fix (carried from 2/17)
- Root cause: Mac Mini sleep killing TCP connections since Feb 14 evening
- Fix: `sudo pmset -a sleep 0 disablesleep 1 displaysleep 0` — sleep fully disabled
- Also suggested: `sudo pmset -a autorestart 1 powernap 0` (Knut hasn't run yet)

## Log Rotation Setup
- Script: `~/.openclaw/scripts/rotate-logs.sh` — rotates logs >500KB, gzips, keeps 7 days
- Cron job: daily at 04:00 Oslo (job ID: be194bc8-96c7-4568-b798-439d0f69d6ac)

## Skills Installed
- **Playwright MCP** — browser automation (clean install)
- **Obsidian Direct** — vault management (force-installed, code reviewed: safe)
- **AgentMail** — agent email infra (force-installed, code reviewed: safe)
- Obsidian vault confirmed at `/Users/knut/.openclaw` (added to TOOLS.md)

## TakstHjem Email Thread (19c60c4e4f80ddc9) — Major Progress
- Answered Andre's 3 unanswered emails (photographer insight, GTM model, legal/eTakst)
- Sent bruksvilkår + disclaimer v0.1 to all three
- Andre pushed back: v0.1 too defensive, undermines product value
- Researched Norwegian eTakst framework: NOT legally regulated, proprietary Eiendomsverdi AS product
- Key finding: utlånsforskriften §4 says nothing about WHO must do valuation — banks have full freedom
- EU/EBA AVM framework explicitly accepts automated valuation models in Norway
- Sent detailed analysis of two paths: join EV system vs build parallel (recommended vei 2)
- Dag challenged B2C value proposition — says standalone valuation won't sell, market too small
- Andre asked about freemium ecosystem model
- Sent market analysis: 1.6M homeowners with loans, 120k+ sales/yr, Renteradar has 300k users as proof-of-concept
- Dag's sharp question: "So we're building a Renteradar competitor? What differentiates us?"
- Answered: Renteradar optimizes within current LTV, TakstHjem updates the valuation first → different rate class
- Played devil's advocate: 5 weaknesses in our own argument (banks already know prices, Renteradar has Hjemla, we have zero data, free megler e-takst, it's just lead-gen)
- Thread now at "minimum viable moat" discussion — waiting for Dag & Andre response

## Key People Context
- **Dag Meltveit** — sharp, skeptical, asks the right hard questions. Good devil's advocate. Challenges B2C assumptions.
- **Andre Gilje** — creative, strategic, generates ideas fast (photographer channel, GTM model, legal analysis). More optimistic.

## Investment Research for Knut
- Thesis: physical-moat companies at low PE that benefit massively from AI admin cost reduction
- Top 5 candidates researched:
  1. **Protector Forsikring** (OSE: PROT) PE ~8-10, 50% admin cut → +39% net income
  2. **Bravida** (STO: BRAV) PE ~12, 50% admin cut → +80% net income
  3. **Coor** (STO: COOR) PE ~10-12, 50% admin cut → +298% net income (low margin = huge leverage)
  4. **Securitas** (STO: SECU B) PE ~14, 50% admin cut → +100% net income
  5. **Sampo** (HEL: SAMPO) PE ~12, 50% admin cut → +55% net income
- Key insight: low-margin service companies (Coor, Bravida) see biggest relative gains from AI admin cuts

## Google Chat
- bottenanna26@gmail.com has Workspace admin access (admin.google.com works)
- But Chat API requires custom domain, not @gmail.com — needs domain added to Workspace
- Parked for now

## Investment Research — Afternoon Session

### Nordic Insurance Deep-Dive
- Ranking: Sampo > Gjensidige > Protector for AI-upside thesis
- **Sampo** (#1 pick): PE 12.3, ROE 26.4%, Topdanmark integration (€140M/yr synergies by 2028), 40bps/yr cost ratio improvement, 63% digital claims, 65K AI photo inspections. Analyst consensus Buy, target €10.54 (+16%)
- **Gjensidige**: PE 21.3, most "fat to cut" but expensive entry
- **Protector**: PE 15.6, ROE 40.4%, already too lean for big AI relative impact

### Novo Nordisk (separate value thesis, not AI)
- PE 13.4 after 60%+ crash, ROE 60.7%, operating margin 44%
- 2026 guidance: 5-13% revenue decline — GLP-1 competition + pricing pressure
- Analyst target DKK 379 (+23%). Value play, not AI thesis.
- Saved to `/Users/knut/.openclaw/Investeringer/Novo Nordisk — Investeringsnotat.md`

### PEG.CO (Pharma Equity Group)
- DKK 0.10 penny stock, pre-revenue biotech, DKK -24M annual loss, cash DKK 4.2M
- Danske Bank target DKK 0.56 (5x) but massive dilution risk — lottery ticket only

### Finance Toolkit Built
- Custom `yf` CLI (15KB, ~400 lines): price, quote, fundamentals, profile, earnings, dividends, ratings, history, compare, search, options
- Custom `screener` (12KB, 105 Nordic symbols): filters PE/ROE/margin/yield/beta/sector
- Stock Market Pro (ClawHub): PNG charts with RSI/MACD/BB/VWAP/ATR
- Screener run: 16 matches. Standout flags: WWI.OL (PE 5.1, margin 52%), Pandora (PE 7.9, ROE 97.5%), Evolution (PE 9.5)

### `trends` Command (in progress)
- Adding historical financials view to `yf` CLI — revenue, margins, EPS over ~4 years via yfinance `.financials`/`.balance_sheet`/`.cashflow`

## Full Disk Access
- Granted FDA to `/usr/local/bin/openclaw` via System Settings → Privacy & Security
- Required gateway restart to take effect
- OpenClaw runs as: `launchd → openclaw-gateway → zsh` (not via Terminal.app)
- Terminal.app FDA alone doesn't help — need the actual binary

## Eloise Lavvo Calendar
- Created 58 all-day events (60 minus 2 holidays) in AutoCalendar
- Midi weeks: 4-5, 8-9, 12-13, 17-18, 21-22, 25-26
- Removed: 1. mai (Arbeidernes dag) + 25. mai (Andre pinsedag)

## Lessons Learned
- eTakst is NOT legally regulated — proprietary Eiendomsverdi AS product (bransjestandard, not law)
- Utlånsforskriften §4 doesn't specify who must do property valuation — banks have full freedom
- Built custom finance tools because ClawHub skill had SKILL.md but no actual code
- Sub-agents with open-ended research tasks burn 200k tokens — give strict constraints
