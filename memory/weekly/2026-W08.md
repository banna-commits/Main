Here's a structured breakdown of the **prefetch pattern** and how to implement it effectively:

---

### 🔄 **Prefetch Pattern Overview**
**Goal:** Optimize costs by offloading data-intensive tasks to a free model (e.g., `qwen3-fast`) and reserving paid models (e.g., `Sonnet`) for analysis/formatting.

---

### 📌 **Implementation Steps**

1. **Data Fetching with Free Model**  
   - **Schedule:** Run `qwen3-fast` 5–10 minutes before the analysis task (e.g., 07:55 for a 08:00 briefing).  
   - **Task:** Use CLI commands to gather data (e.g., API calls, file reads).  
   - **Output:** Save results to a file (e.g., `briefing-data.txt`).  

   ```bash
   # Example: Fetch data using qwen3-fast
   qwen3-fast --fetch-data > briefing-data.txt
   ```

2. **Analysis with Paid Model**  
   - **Schedule:** Run `Sonnet` at the scheduled time (e.g., 08:00).  
   - **Task:** Read the pre-fetched file and format the output (e.g., email, report).  
   - **Avoid CLI commands** during this phase to save costs.  

   ```bash
   # Example: Sonnet reads pre-fetched data
   sonnet --format-briefing briefing-data.txt > briefing-output.md
   ```

3. **Logging & Validation**  
   - **Log all steps** to a daily memory file (e.g., `daily-logs.md`) for audit.  
   - **Verify** the output file exists and is correctly formatted before proceeding.  

---

### 🧠 **Key Benefits**
- **Cost Efficiency:** Free model handles heavy lifting; paid model focuses on high-value tasks.  
- **Speed:** Reduces Sonnet runtime by avoiding redundant CLI work.  
- **Scalability:** Easily adapt for other cron jobs (e.g., reports, data aggregation).  

---

### 🛠️ **Example Workflow**
1. **07:55 (qwen3-fast):**  
   ```bash
   qwen3-fast --scrape-data > briefing-data.txt
   ```
2. **08:00 (Sonnet):**  
   ```bash
   sonnet --format-briefing briefing-data.txt > briefing-output.md
   ```
3. **08:15 (Optional):**  
   ```bash
   send-mail --attachment briefing-output.md
   ```

---

### ⚠️ **Best Practices**
- **Isolated Sessions:** Use exact commands in cron jobs (no memory retention).  
- **Error Handling:** Add checks to ensure files exist before processing.  
- **Monitor Costs:** Track usage of paid models to avoid unexpected charges.  

By following this pattern, you minimize costs while maintaining efficiency and reliability in your automation pipeline. 🚀
