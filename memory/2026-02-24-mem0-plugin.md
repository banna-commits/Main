## Conversation Summary

assistant: Config written. Now restart the gateway to load the plugin:
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "61c2c209-8ab0-47c5-b87c-02eae21716cc",
  "sender_id": "openclaw-control-ui",
  "sender": "openclaw-control-ui"
}
```

[Tue 2026-02-24 22:10 GMT+1] how are we looking?
assistant: Still showing disabled. The config is there but it's not loading — might need to be in `plugins.allow` since it's a non-bundled plugin:
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "85c66f6f-6f88-48a3-b197-dcfb658640ae",
  "sender_id": "openclaw-control-ui",
  "sender": "openclaw-control-ui"
}
```

[Tue 2026-02-24 22:11 GMT+1] now?
assistant: Hmm, still disabled and fewer plugins loaded (went from 6 to 2). The `allow` list is restrictive — it only loads what's listed. Let me check more carefully:
assistant: Wait, the entry is empty? Let me check the full plugins section:
assistant: My earlier edit got lost (probably the restart reverted or I had the wrong config). And the `allow` delete didn't save. Let me redo both properly:
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "863bfb6c-f158-4ebf-848e-f60f049b0a3b",
  "sender_id": "openclaw-control-ui",
  "sender": "openclaw-control-ui"
}
```

[Tue 2026-02-24 22:16 GMT+1] think you smashed the config up, lets try again
assistant: Ah — the gateway restart overwrites the config and strips out unrecognized keys. It only kept `enabled: true` and dropped all the mem0-specific config (mode, oss, etc.) because the config schema validation rejects them.

Plugin config probably goes in a separate section, not inside `plugins.entries`. Let me check the docs:
assistant: It goes under `plugins.entries.<id>.config`! Not at the top level of the entry.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "4615bdaa-a1ce-474f-930a-54bd8da43af6",
  "sender_id": "openclaw-control-ui",
  "sender": "openclaw-control-ui"
}
```

[Tue 2026-02-24 22:16 GMT+1] how does it look now?
assistant: The memory slot is taken by `memory-core`. Only one memory plugin can be active. Need to switch the slot:
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "1ebf3ec0-19e2-438d-ad02-748406a44f12",
  "sender_id": "openclaw-control-ui",
  "sender": "openclaw-control-ui"
}
```

[Tue 2026-02-24 22:17 GMT+1] how does it look now?
assistant: Still the same — memory-core is loaded despite me disabling it. There must be a "memory slot" mechanism that defaults to memory-core. Let me check how to set it:
assistant: There it is — `plugins.slots.memory`:
