## Gmail / Google Workspace Setup
- Set up `gog` CLI with OAuth for **bottenanna26@gmail.com**
- Services enabled: gmail, calendar, drive, contacts, docs, sheets
- OAuth client type: **Desktop app** (Web app caused redirect_uri_mismatch)
- Client ID: `258225610371-hmm7cjhs8gglseg4g7luota14vmi7pta.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Had to add bottenanna26@gmail.com as test user in OAuth consent screen (app in Testing mode)
- Had to enable Gmail API (and other APIs) manually in Cloud Console
- Knut also created a Pub/Sub topic (for Gmail push notifications?)
- Auth confirmed working at ~09:50 UTC

## Gmail Push Notifications
- Pub/Sub topic: `projects/project-9906db25-afbf-4296-840/topics/gog-gmail-watch`
- Subscription: `gog-gmail-watch-push`
- Push endpoint via Tailscale Funnel: `https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail37c89c.ts.net/gmail-pubsub`
- Wizard: `openclaw webhooks gmail setup` handled most of the wiring
- Gateway auto-starts `gog gmail watch serve` on boot
- Hook mapping with `messageTemplate` required — without it, got "hook mapping requires message" 400 error
- Delivers to Telegram (Knut's ID: 856859835)
- Tested and working

## Heartbeat
- Enabled every 30 minutes, target: telegram
- HEARTBEAT.md created with rotating checks: email, calendar, memory maintenance
- Quiet hours: 23:00–08:00
- State tracked in `memory/heartbeat-state.json`

## Email Draft Flow
- Knut forwards emails to bottenanna26@gmail.com
- I read, draft a reply, send it back to knutgreiner@gmail.com
- He reviews and sends from his own address
- Tested with Aider årsregnskap email — worked well

## AutoCalendar
- Created shared calendar "AutoCalendar" between bottenanna26 and knutgreiner (both owners)
- Calendar ID: `5d31d8d99ae65410e7af8b6edeb48c7803c576e5efe3c83a5f8f1ccd687e6e21@group.calendar.google.com`
- First event: "Dinner and show with Bjarki Tujen" Feb 21, 12:00–20:00

## Config Optimizations
- Gmail hooks: Sonnet model, thinking off (cheaper)
- Heartbeats: Sonnet model, every 30 min, target Telegram
- Opus reserved for direct conversations only

## Pitch Deck — Boligverdi Challenger
- Built visual HTML pitch deck for B2C e-takst startup challenging boligverdi.no
- Saved at `/pitch/index.html` — 9 slides, Norwegian copy, dark navy design
- Emailed to Andre Gilje (andregilje@hotmail.com) with HTML attached
- Andre added to contacts

## Contacts
- Andre Gilje: andregilje@hotmail.com (people/c4850180699289520560)
- Dag Meltveit: dag.meltveit@gmail.com (people/c6367254585907834199)

## Pitch Deck Iterations
- First send: HTML attachment to Andre + Dag — they couldn't easily open it
- Created print.html (all slides stacked, A4 landscape, no JS) for PDF export
- Re-exported PDF with all 9 slides via browser PDF
- First PDF only had 1 page (JS navigation hid other slides)
- Created print.html with all slides stacked, no JS
- Second PDF had pages tangled/overlapping — content overflowed fixed A4 height
- Fixed with scale(0.85) on slide-inner + reduced padding
- Third PDF attempt — waiting for Knut to confirm
- Sent updated PDFs to Andre + Dag twice — neither looked great
- Final solution: hosted HTML via Tailscale Funnel at https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail37c89c.ts.net/pitch/index.html
- Python static server on port 8890 serving /Users/knut/.openclaw/workspace/pitch/
- Tailscale funnel path /pitch → http://127.0.0.1:8890
- Sent clean link to Andre + Dag with apology for the mess
- NOTE: server needs to be running for link to work — restart if Mac reboots

## Andre's Response
- Andre Gilje replied to the TakstHjem pitch — he liked it!
- Wants analysis of eiendomsverdi.no and how TakstHjem can disrupt them
- Notified Knut on Telegram, waiting for his go-ahead to research

## Google Doc "APP"
- Martin Knutsen Tran (martin.knutsen.tran@vend.com) shared a Google Doc called "APP" for editing
- Doc URL: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JXXjxYL-6qlHW8UuRi8CxXhGANW6Znu-5jY_R1gNjCM/edit
- Forwarded from knutgreiner@gmail.com — likely relevant to Knut

## Pitch Server Maintenance
- The python3 http server on port 8890 keeps dying between heartbeats
- Every heartbeat I've had to restart it
- May need a more persistent solution (launchd, pm2, etc.)

## "Into the Body" App (Martin's project)
- Martin Knutsen Tran (martin.knutsen.tran@vend.com) shared Google Doc "APP" with spec
- Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JXXjxYL-6qlHW8UuRi8CxXhGANW6Znu-5jY_R1gNjCM/edit
- Somatic body awareness / sensing app — guided 2-4 min sessions
- 7-step flow: Settle In → Body Scan → Locate Sensation → Describe → Stay With It → Label Emotion → Close
- 7-day challenge with daily themes
- Built React Native/Expo MVP at /Users/knut/.openclaw/workspace/into-the-body/
- Features: tappable SVG body map (15 zones), breathing animations, timer ring, AsyncStorage persistence
- Expo dev server running on localhost:8081
- Knut asked to build in React Native specifically
- Expo Go issues:
  - Missing babel-preset-expo → npm install fixed it
  - WorkletsError: react-native-reanimated worklets version mismatch (0.7.3 vs 0.5.1 in Expo Go)
  - Fix: removed react-native-reanimated entirely, replaced with React Native built-in Animated API
  - Also removed react-native-reanimated/plugin from babel.config.js
  - All animations preserved (breathing circle, fade, pulse, timer ring)
- Expo dev server: exp://10.0.0.28:8081 (local IP)
- Knut's Expo Go on iPhone, no simulator

## Eiendomsverdi.no Research & Report
- Built detailed competitive analysis: /pitch/eiendomsverdi-analyse.html
- Hosted at: https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail37c89c.ts.net/pitch/eiendomsverdi-analyse.html
- Key finding: Eiendomsverdi is purely B2B (55 employees, since 2000, ISO 9001)
- They explicitly refuse consumers — "kun for profesjonelle aktører"
- Products: property database, e-takst, AVM, 30yr historical data, climate data
- Customers: banks, insurance, realtors, appraisers, government
- Disruption angle: democratize property valuation B2C
- Sent report to Andre (CC Dag) as reply to his request
- Andre replied again — wants deeper dive on Eiendomsverdi's data supply chain:
  - Where do they get their data (historic, present, future sources)
  - Who owns the data they use
  - Who provides the detailed information
  - Is any of the data paid for
- Notified Knut on Telegram, he said "gjør grundig research og svar begge"
- Researched Eiendomsverdi's data supply chain:
  - 7 sources: Kartverket (public), SSB (public), Eiendom Norge (privileged), FINN (paid), Ambita (paid), municipalities, energy certs
  - Most data is replicable from public sources
  - Key moat: Eiendom Norge relationship + 30yr historical dataset
  - TakstHjem angle: consumer-contributed data (photos, renovations) is a gap
- Sent detailed email to Andre (CC Dag) covering all questions
- Email saved at /pitch/ev-data-research.txt

## Contacts
- Martin Knutsen Tran: martin.knutsen.tran@vend.com (shared the APP doc)

## MVP Plan Email to Andre
- Spawned subagent to compile and send TakstHjem MVP/go-to-market plan to Andre (CC Dag)
- 4 phases: validation (~1,500 NOK landing page test) → concierge MVP → semi-automated app → scale
- Philosophy: don't build until people pay. Under 5,000 NOK to first paying customer.
- Saved at /pitch/ev-mvp-plan.txt
- Thread ID: 19c60c4e4f80ddc9

## "Into the Body" — Body Silhouette Iterations
- Original hand-drawn SVG paths looked like "Michelin man" / blocky robot
- Knut sent reference image (depositphotos medical pain illustration) for style
- Tried multiple approaches:
  1. Hand-drawn SVG paths (multiple attempts) → alien/spagetti-legs
  2. Geometric shapes (ellipses, rects) → crash test dummy
  3. Single continuous path silhouette → still alien-like
  4. **react-native-body-highlighter** library → professional anatomical SVG ✅
- Library: `HichamELBSI/react-native-body-highlighter` (npm package)
- Has male/female variants, muscle group slugs, tap handlers built in
- Fixed head color: library defaults head to #bebebe (light), overrode to #3f3f3f via data intensity
- **Knut chose female model** — more unisex feel, better for meditation app
- Lesson: don't hand-draw SVG paths without a visual editor. Use existing libraries.

## Andre's Follow-up — Wants MVP → Landing Page Built
- Andre replied to the go-to-market plan: "Can you make a mvp to review?"
- Knut approved building a landing page
- Built TakstHjem landing page at `/pitch/taksthjem/index.html`
  - Dark navy theme, Norwegian, mobile-responsive
  - Hero, how-it-works (3 steps), pricing (990 kr), testimonials, FAQ, waitlist form
  - Waitlist form uses placeholder Formspree endpoint — needs real ID for production
- Live at: https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail37c89c.ts.net/pitch/taksthjem/
- Sent link to Andre (CC Dag) in thread 19c60c4e4f80ddc9
- Martin Knutsen Tran coming over in the weekend to finpusse "Into the Body" app

## Brave Search API
- Set up Brave Search API account with bottenanna26@gmail.com
- Free plan (2000 søk/mnd)
- API key configured via `openclaw configure --section web`
- Gateway restarted to activate

## Pitch Server → launchd
- Created launchd plist at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openclaw.pitchserver.plist
- Auto-starts at boot, KeepAlive=true, auto-restarts on crash
- Removed manual restart check from HEARTBEAT.md
- No more dying between heartbeats!

## Dag's Feedback on TakstHjem Pitch
- Dag Meltveit replied with detailed concerns (late Sunday night)
- 4 main concerns: data access/regulation, incumbent moats, technical feasibility, GTM/revenue model
- Wants additional research/analysis to increase comfort
- Specifically asks about: data licensing validation, competitive differentiation strategy, benchmarked accuracy claims, clear niche with willingness to pay
- This is serious due diligence — he's engaged but cautious
- Notified Knut on Telegram, awaiting instructions

## Knut's Calendar
- Knut bruker ikke privat Google Calendar
- AutoCalendar er eneste kalender vi trenger å sjekke

## Setup Notes for Future Reference
- Google Cloud project is in "Testing" mode — only test users can auth
- If adding new accounts, remember to add them as test users first
- `GOG_ACCOUNT=bottenanna26@gmail.com` can be set to avoid repeating --account
