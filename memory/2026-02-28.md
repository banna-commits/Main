- Daily Health Check: switched to GPT-5.1, timeout 600s, manual run succeeded and sent workspace-size warning to Telegram.
- Daily Self-Test: timeout raised to 900s, prompt updated to remind `message` action=send; manual rerun succeeded and cleared consecutive errors.

## 11:45 gateway config
- Raised agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds from 120s to 600s via `openclaw gateway config.patch` so cron jobs inherit longer default timeout without manual overrides; gateway auto-restarted (SIGUSR1).

## 13:28 instruction
- Knut: stop pausing after setbacks (cron crash etc.); stay autonomous and resume immediately so progress stays high. Also capture that I should self-drive on approved tasks without waiting.

## 14:25 weekly memory consolidation
- Ran scripts/memory-consolidate.sh → memory-decay auto flow; summarized 14 files into weekly digest 2026-W08.md and archived Feb 16–21 dailies.
- Reviewed Feb 22–28 logs; updated memory/infra (Mission Control, cron watchdogs, Gmail OAuth status), memory/projects (Mission Control summary), memory/preferences (autonomy rule), memory/lessons (gog pager fix), and saved new sandbox-runner pattern.
- Finished with scripts/memory-commit.sh (auto-commit 2026-02-28).
