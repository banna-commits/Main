Hi Andre,

Thanks for the conversation about TakstHjem. I've been thinking about how to approach this realistically — given that everyone's working full-time with no funding. Here's a concrete, step-by-step plan to go from zero to revenue with minimal risk.

The core idea: don't build anything until you've proven people will pay.


## PHASE 0: VALIDATE DEMAND (Week 1-2 | Cost: ~1,500 NOK)

Before writing a single line of code, answer one question: will homeowners pay 990 NOK for a digital property valuation?

- Set up a landing page on Carrd.co (199 NOK/yr) with a clear value prop: "Få en digital verdivurdering av boligen din på 24 timer — fra 990 kr"
- Add an email signup / waitlist form
- Register a domain (takstHjem.no or similar, ~200 NOK/yr)
- Run a small Facebook/Instagram ad campaign targeting homeowners in ONE city — Bergen or Stavanger are good candidates. Budget: 500-1,000 NOK
- Target: 50+ email signups in 2 weeks

If you get 50+ signups, you have signal. If you get 10, rethink the positioning. If you get 0, you just saved yourself months of wasted evenings. Total cost to find out: ~1,500 NOK.


## PHASE 1: CONCIERGE MVP (Month 1-2 | Cost: ~5,000 NOK)

Now you have interested people. Serve them — manually. No tech, no app, no automation.

How it works:
- Customer fills out a Google Form or Typeform (free tier) with property details + photos
- Payment via Vipps business (free to set up) or Stripe — charge 990 NOK upfront
- Behind the scenes, YOU do the valuation manually using free data sources:
  - Kartverket (Eiendomsregisteret — grunnbok + matrikkel data)
  - FINN.no for comparable sales in the area (manual search)
  - SSB area statistics and price indices
  - Your own analysis and judgment
- Deliver a professional-looking PDF report (create a template in Canva or Google Docs)
- Target delivery within 24 hours

Goal: 10-20 paying customers. This teaches you:
- What customers actually care about in the report
- Which data sources matter most
- How long each valuation takes (your unit economics)
- What questions/complaints come up

This is the most important phase. Every minute spent here saves you 10 hours of building the wrong thing later.


## PHASE 2: SEMI-AUTOMATED (Month 3-6 | Cost: ~15,000-20,000 NOK)

Once you've done 20+ manual valuations and understand the workflow, start automating the painful parts.

- Build a simple web app (Next.js on Vercel — free hosting)
- Integrate free APIs: Kartverket API for property data, SSB for statistics
- Scrape or integrate FINN comparable sales data
- Auto-generate a basic report draft, then human review before delivery
- Add Vipps checkout for seamless payment
- Start basic SEO + Google Ads targeting "verdivurdering bolig", "boligverdi", "hva er boligen min verdt"

Goal: 50+ customers/month with proven unit economics. At 990 NOK × 50 = ~50,000 NOK/month revenue, you have a real business.


## PHASE 3: SCALE (Month 6-12)

Only if Phase 2 proves the economics:
- Partner with certified takstmenn to offer official e-takst
- Build an AVM (Automated Valuation Model) from your accumulated data
- Consider pre-seed funding — with real revenue and traction, fundraising is 10x easier
- Mobile app if demand justifies it


## KEY PRINCIPLES

- Don't build tech until you've validated with manual work — code is expensive, forms are free
- Charge from day 1 — if people won't pay 990 NOK, the business doesn't work, and you need to know that NOW
- One city first — nail Bergen before thinking about Oslo
- Evenings and weekends — this plan is designed for full-time employed founders doing 5-10 hrs/week
- Revenue before funding — investors love traction, not slide decks


## BUDGET SUMMARY

| Phase | Cost | Timeline |
|-------|------|----------|
| Validate (landing page + ads) | ~1,500 NOK | Week 1-2 |
| Concierge MVP (manual service) | ~5,000 NOK | Month 1-2 |
| Semi-automated platform | ~15,000-20,000 NOK | Month 3-6 |
| Scale | Revenue-funded | Month 6-12 |

Total to go from idea to first paying customer: under 5,000 NOK.


## NEXT STEPS

1. Pick a city (I'd suggest Bergen — good size, tech-savvy, not Oslo-competitive)
2. Set up the landing page this weekend
3. Launch a 1,000 NOK ad test next week
4. See what happens

This is 100% doable as a side project. Airbnb started with air mattresses and a website. Zappos started by buying shoes at the store and shipping them manually. The pattern is always the same: prove demand with manual work, then automate what works.

I'm happy to help with the landing page setup and the technical architecture when you get to Phase 2. Let's jump on a call if you want to hash out the details.

Best,
Knut
