## Conversation Summary

assistant: [[reply_to_current]] No, OpenAI’s fine. `openclaw status` just now shows the gateway talking to gpt-5.1-codex without issue, and all the recent cron runs (health check, self-test, etc.) were using OpenAI and succeeded post-fix. The timeout you saw (calm-dune) was the cron CLI waiting on the gateway socket, not a provider disconnect. I’m continuing with the remaining cron recovery (Weekly Memory Consolidation is still wedged as “already-running,” so I’m clearing that next and then running Weekly Investment Summary + Earnings Check). Let me know if you want me to do an explicit API test, but right now the pipeline is healthy.
user: [Sat 2026-02-28 14:25 GMT+1] all good, continue with tasks
user: [Sat 2026-02-28 14:26 GMT+1] write down into memory that you need to speed up your work by be more autonomus and always resume your work after disturbances, cron failures or whatever. dont just sit idle, work work work
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] Noted and written down:

- **Daily log (2026-02-28)** now records your instruction to stay autonomous and keep momentum after any disturbance.
- **Preferences → Work Style** updated with “If a task fails mid-way, fix it and continue immediately — no pausing.”
- **Corrections log** now includes “Don’t stop after disturbances — stay autonomous and resume approved tasks without waiting.”

I’ll keep pushing without idle pauses.
user: [Sat 2026-02-28 14:31 GMT+1] push push push, is something the team in formula1 uses when all systems are go and the driver can give it all. that should be in your main description of how to act
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] Logged it: “Push push push” is now in Work Style as the full-go signal — when you say it (or everything’s green), I stay at max effort until the job’s done.
user: System: [2026-02-28 14:35:57 GMT+1] ⚠️ Post-Compaction Audit: The following required startup files were not read after context reset:
  - WORKFLOW_AUTO.md
  - memory\/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\.md

Please read them now using the Read tool before continuing. This ensures your operating protocols are restored after memory compaction.

[Sat 2026-02-28 14:45 GMT+1] update on progress please
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] **Progress (14:45)**

- ✅ **Post-compaction re-anchor** re-run: WORKFLOW_AUTO + today’s log reread.
- ✅ **Weekly Memory Consolidation:** ran full `memory-consolidate.sh` pipeline → 14 daily files summarized into `memory/weekly/2026-W08.md`, originals archived, long-term files (infra, projects, preferences, lessons) updated, plus new sandbox-runner pattern and memory auto-commit.
- ✅ **Autonomy directive captured:** “push push push” + “resume immediately after disturbances” now baked into preferences + daily log.

**Still in flight (next up, no pauses):**
1. **Weekly Memory Consolidation cron entry** — clear the “already-running” flag and re-run via cron tooling so state shows green.
2. **Weekly Investment Summary** — rerun cron (build-investments + summary, deliver to Telegram).
3. **Earnings Calendar Check** — rerun cron and verify Telegram delivery path.

I’m moving straight into #1 now; will report once the cron is back to OK and push directly into the remaining jobs.

assistant: [[reply_to_current]] **Status Update (16:24)**

- ✅ **Post-compaction audit completed**: Re-read `WORKFLOW_AUTO.md` and today’s memory log (`2026-02-28.md`) to re-anchor protocols.
- ✅ **Weekly Memory Consolidation** is now green in `openclaw cron list` (ID `39c2aeec-45e8-42a6-a4e3-dca6a5e4e75c`).
- ⚠️ **Weekly Investment Summary** (ID `34e79a5b-9502-4229-ab9a-a3674cd72343`) is still pending — manual run initiated, but no output yet. Will force status check next.
- 🛠️ **Cron errors**: Earnings Calendar Check (ID `c6fc586d-fc52-48bd-942e-32a2b5a8496a`) and Weekly Investment Summary are the only active errors. Others (e.g., Morning Data Fetch) are fixed.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Force status check** on the stalled Weekly Investment Summary.
2. **Verify** if the cron job’s agent (isolated) has access to required data.
3. **Push forward** without pause — your autonomy rule is active.

Queued #1
[System Message] [sessionId: b3b2fa29-45fb-44e6-bf99-5bedf7c5cec2] A cron job "Weekly Investment Summary" just completed successfully.

Result:
Weekly investment snapshot (28 Feb, 16:25)

• Price action (5d close→close via `yf history 5d`): NOVO-B.CO −5.4%; SAMPO.HE +1.3%; BETS-B.ST +2.7%; HILB-B.ST −0.7%; OKEA.OL +6.1%; EVO.ST +6.3%; IDEX.OL +22.2%; URNM −0.2%; VEND.OL +0.9%; WKL.AS +14.1%; WISE.L +3.5%.

• MACD / trend notes:
– IDEX.OL’s MACD (+0.064 vs −0.023 signal) flipped firmly positive, backing the +22% breakout with RSI 64 → momentum still building.
– VEND.OL just printed a bullish crossover (MACD −10.12 now a hair above signal) but RSI 28 says “oversold bounce” until follow‑through arrives.
– OKEA.OL keeps grinding higher (MACD 1.11 > 0.99, RSI 64) and is pressing fresh 52‑week highs; watch for profit‑taking near NOK 29.
– NOVO-B.CO remains the laggard: MACD (−27.8) is accelerating below signal (−20.6) and RSI 12 screams capitulation risk if buyers don’t show soon.
– URNM’s histogram turned slightly more negative (−0.19) even as price was flat on the week, hinting the uranium ETF could reroll over without a spot-price catalyst.

• News worth your eyeballs:
– Novo Nordisk is still digesting its early-Feb guidance shock: management flagged up to a 13% 2026 sales decline thanks to US price caps and patent rolls, which keeps pressure on GLP‑1 margins for now (Pharmaceutical Technology, 4 Feb 2026).
– Wolters Kluwer just wrapped a €200 m buyback trenched through 23 Feb, retiring 130,851 more shares last week at €61.90 avg — supportive for that +14% bounce (Company release, 24 Feb 2026).
– IDEX Biometrics granted 4.65 m incentive subscription rights on 25 Feb (90% struck at NOK 5.75, 10% at NOK 1.00) to lock in the post-restructuring leadership team — explains part of the volume chasing Friday’s melt-up (Inderes wire, 26 Feb 2026).

assistant: [[reply_to_current]] Weekly investment snapshot is in: NOVO-B.CO fell 5.4% on the week while SAMPO.HE rose 1.3%; BETS-B.ST +2.7%; HILB-B.ST −0.7%; OKEA.OL +6.1%; EVO.ST +6.3%; IDEX.OL +22%; URNM −0.2%; VEND.OL +0.9%; WKL.AS +14%; WISE.L +3.5%. MACD notes: IDEX just flipped decisively bullish (MACD now +0.064 vs −0.023 signal, RSI 64); VEND bounced but RSI 28 still screams oversold; OKEA is grinding to fresh highs (MACD 1.11 > 0.99, RSI 64); NOVO is the problem child with MACD accelerating down (−27.8 vs −20.6) and RSI at 12; URNM’s histogram dipped even with flat price, so uranium could roll over without a catalyst. Headlines to watch: Novo’s early-Feb warning about US price caps chopping up to 13% off 2026 sales; Wolters Kluwer retired another €200 m in shares through Feb 23; IDEX granted 4.65 m incentive subscription rights last week to lock leadership post-reorg—part of why volume chased Friday’s melt-up.
