## 10:12 cron fixes
- Morning Data Fetch: bumped cron timeout to 300s + switched to GPT-5.1; manual cron run succeeded ("Updated 17 assets") after calling `openclaw cron run --timeout 180000 e58dbf72-...`.
- Ollama Warmup: added curl `--connect-timeout 5 --max-time 25`, bumped cron timeout to 300s, verified manual run works via `openclaw cron run 4cf7bfaa-...`.
- Daily Health Check: switched to GPT-5.1, timeout 600s, manual run succeeded and sent workspace-size warning to Telegram.
- Daily Self-Test: timeout raised to 900s, prompt updated to remind `message` action=send; manual rerun succeeded and cleared consecutive errors.
- Morning Prefetch: weather parsing no longer flips FAIL when wttr.in empties; manual script run + watchdog confirm healthy.
## 11:06 heartbeat

## 11:45 gateway config
- Raised agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds from 120s to 600s via `openclaw gateway config.patch` so cron jobs inherit longer default timeout without manual overrides; gateway auto-restarted (SIGUSR1).

## 13:28 instruction
- Knut: stop pausing after setbacks (cron crash etc.); stay autonomous and resume immediately so progress stays high. Also capture that I should self-drive on approved tasks without waiting.

## 14:25 weekly memory consolidation
- Ran scripts/memory-consolidate.sh → memory-decay auto flow; summarized 14 files into weekly digest 2026-W08.md and archived Feb 16–21 dailies.
- Reviewed Feb 22–28 logs; updated memory/infra (Mission Control, cron watchdogs, Gmail OAuth status), memory/projects (Mission Control summary), memory/preferences (autonomy rule), memory/lessons (gog pager fix), and saved new sandbox-runner pattern.
- Finished with scripts/memory-commit.sh (auto-commit 2026-02-28).

## 16:25 weekly investment summary
- Cron ping: ran build-investments.sh, pulled latest investments.json, and scripted yf history (5d) per ticker to get weekly ## 16:25 weekly investment summary
- Cron ping: ran build-investments.sh, pulled latest investments.json, and scripted `yf history` (5d) per ticker to capture weekly % moves before drafting the Telegram summary (price action, MACD notes, fresh news).

- Changed all non-local cron jobs to use gemini-2.5-flash-lite due to GPT cooldown.
## 22:49 mission control
- Force-killed stray next-server processes that were causing port 3001 EADDRINUSE collisions, and restarted the launchd service to restore Mission Control availability.
