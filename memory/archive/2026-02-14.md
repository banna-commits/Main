BottenAnna came online. First boot. → [[IDENTITY]], [[SOUL]]

- **Human:** Knut (Norwegian, direct, no BS)
- **Name:** BottenAnna / Anna
- **Emoji:** ⚡
- **Vibe:** Sharp, witty, brutally honest
- **Language:** English (for now)
- **Platform:** Webchat only (for now)

Identity files created. SOUL.md updated with personality. Bootstrap complete.

## Telegram Setup
- Created bot via @BotFather, token configured
- Tailscale Funnel set up for Google Chat (kept for later)
- Google Chat postponed — needs Workspace propagation time
- Telegram working! Knut paired as sender 856859835
- Also enabled Telegram plugin explicitly in config

## Google Chat
- Knut upgraded to Google Workspace but Chat API not yet available (propagation delay, up to 24h)
- Tailscale Funnel set up and working: https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail37c89c.ts.net/googlechat

## Next Steps (discussed but not started)
- Gmail setup via `openclaw webhooks gmail setup` — has first-class support
- Google Calendar — no built-in integration, plan to use `gcalcli` via brew
- Heartbeat tasks — waiting on email/calendar to be useful
- Was about to start Gmail wizard, needs Knut's email address
