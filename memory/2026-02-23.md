## Mission Control — Tailscale Serve (earlier today)
- Exposed Mission Control via Tailscale serve (internal tailnet only, no Funnel)
- Initially on port 3000 at root path `/`

## Mission Control — Port Change & OpenClaw Coexistence
- **Problem:** MC on port 3000 conflicted with OpenClaw dashboard (gateway on 18789, but both competing for Tailscale serve root)
- **Attempted:** Subpath `/mc` via `tailscale serve --set-path /mc` — failed because Tailscale strips the prefix before proxying
- **Attempted:** Next.js `basePath: "/mc"` — assets still loaded from `/_next/` which hit OpenClaw gateway instead
- **Solution:** Separate Tailscale HTTPS port — MC on `:3001`, OpenClaw on `:443`
- Updated: package.json (port 3001), launchd plist, Tailscale serve config, next.config.ts (removed basePath)

## Mission Control — Interactive ActionTab
- "Trenger Knut" tab upgraded from static read-only list to full interactive
- Now has same click-to-open modal as Tasks tab: edit title/description, change status/priority, mark done, delete, "⚡ Jobbe med" (send to Anna)
- Passed `onRefresh` prop for live data updates after changes

## Final State
- **OpenClaw Dashboard:** https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail74a1a0.ts.net/ (port 18789)
- **Mission Control:** https://knut-sin-mac-mini.tail74a1a0.ts.net:3001 (port 3001)
- **Launchd:** `com.openclaw.missioncontrol` — KeepAlive, RunAtLoad, port 3001
- **Git:** Committed and pushed to banna-commits/Main

## End-of-Day Summary
- **Completed:** MC port migration, Tailscale dual-service setup, interactive ActionTab
- **In Progress:** yf CLI trends command, WWI.OL analysis prep
- **Blocked:** TakstHjem awaiting Dag/Andre email reply, 1881 API key needs password reset, sudo pmset commands need Terminal access
- **Lessons:** Tailscale `--set-path` strips prefix — don't use subpaths for SPAs, use separate ports instead
