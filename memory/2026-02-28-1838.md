## Conversation Summary

user: System: [2026-02-28 19:28:42 GMT+1] ⚠️ Post-Compaction Audit: The following required startup files were not read after context reset:
  - WORKFLOW_AUTO.md
  - memory\/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\.md

Please read them now using the Read tool before continuing. This ensures your operating protocols are restored after memory compaction.

[Sat 2026-02-28 19:29 GMT+1] hello
assistant: Hello. I've successfully re-anchored myself after the memory compaction.

I've read `WORKFLOW_AUTO.md` and the daily logs for yesterday and today.
**Status:**
- **System:** Recovered and active.
- **Context:** I know about the recent cron fix efforts (switching models, bumping timeouts) and the weekly investment/memory tasks that ran today.
- **Heartbeat:** All recent checks (email/calendar) have been quiet.

I'm ready to work. What's next?
user: [Sat 2026-02-28 19:30 GMT+1] what llm is currently running?
assistant: **Current LLM:** google/gemini-3-pro-preview

This is the model actively driving this session. If you need to switch or check other models (like `qwen3-fast` for background tasks), let me know.
user: [Sat 2026-02-28 19:31 GMT+1] ok super then we are up and running , dont use anthropic or gpt models as they are all in cooldown. can you temporarly suspend them in all cron jobs etc and only run gemini models and local models please
