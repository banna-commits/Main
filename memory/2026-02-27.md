- Started t21: added cron log API + Cron tab scaffolding in Mission Control; wiring in-progress while lint fixes pending

## 18:05 sandbox workspace
- Finished t22: added sandbox/ (gitignored) + scripts/sandbox-sync.sh helper so risky experiments can live outside git and rsync artifacts back via CLI

## 18:20 state snapshot
- Finished t23: added state.json + scripts/state_snapshot.py helper, documented workflow (AGENTS/WORKFLOW_AUTO/TOOLS) so compaction recovery pulls latest commands/next steps

## 18:30 state snapshot automation

- Initial run highlights all the Claude misconfigured jobs + Infra Sync timeouts for follow-up

- Reworked Mission Control tabs: reverted classic styling, added flex-wrap + nowrap so text stops overlapping without blowing up layout
## 19:45 t26 complete

## 20:07 tasks

## 21:26 cron fixes
- Added new 'Ollama Warmup' cron (55 1,7,13,19 * * *) hitting localhost:11434 to keep qwen3-fast hot 5 min before each Infra Sync window; delivery disabled so it just runs the curl and logs failures.

## 21:32 heartbeat
- Calendar sweep (primary empty; AutoCalendar shows Eloise Lavvo + Ha med dag all-day through Feb 28). Logged timestamp in heartbeat-state.
## 23:10 cron failure
- Nightly memory-digest cron (23:10) crashed: scripts/memory-digest.py couldn't extract JSON from model output (`ValueError: No JSON object in model response`). Needs follow-up so digest pipeline produces valid JSON again.

## 23:31 heartbeat
