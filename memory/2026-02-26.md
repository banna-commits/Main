## 05:35 heartbeat

## 06:05 heartbeat
- Calendar sweep (primary + AutoCalendar) for the next 48h: primary still empty; AutoCalendar lists the existing carnival/lavvo all-day blocks (Karneval bhgen, 🎭 Karneval, Eloise Lavvo) with nothing starting within 2h, so no alert sent during quiet hours

## 06:37 heartbeat

- Calendar sweep (primary blank; AutoCalendar only shows the all-day carnival/lavvo entries spanning Feb 26–28, nothing starting within 2h)

## 09:35 status check
- Confirmed morning briefing prefetch is still failing; cron job times out after 120s and `briefing-data.txt` hasn't updated since Feb 22

## 09:55 manual prefetch test
- Tried running briefing prefetch script manually with 300s timeout; Gmail research read loop forced a pager (`Next page` prompt) and script waited indefinitely, then weather step previously tripped SSL verify until switched to curl; still need to adjust script (e.g., `--plain` or `--json` / `--no-input`) before rerunning

## 10:07 heartbeat
- Email check (newer_than:2h) — no unread
- Calendar check (primary empty; AutoCalendar only ongoing all-day carnival/lavvo blocks already logged)

## 09:55 troubleshooting
- Raised prefetch timeout to 300s and attempted manual run; weather curl succeeded but script hung due to gog pagination/pager, showing `# Next page...` and never finishing before manual kill. Need to adjust gog commands (plain/no pager) before re-test.

## 10:10 prefetch fix
- Updated Morning Briefing Prefetch cron instructions to export `GOG_PAGER=cat` and add `--plain --no-input` to all gog commands to keep them non-interactive; still need to re-test run after change

## 10:35 prefetch retest attempts
- New script still hanging during research read because gog outputs pager prompts; added `PAGER=cat` and re-ran, but job stalled on wttr.in fetch (curl stuck). Killing process triggered cron errors. Need to add curl timeouts and confirm gog respecting --plain --no-input.

## 10:39 heartbeat
- Confirmed prefetch test still failing: wttr.in request timed out leading to python JSON decode failure; briefing-data updated partially but run exited code 1. Need to add curl --connect-timeout/--max-time and parse errors.

## 11:09 heartbeat
- Email check (`newer_than:2h is:unread`) came back empty; logged timestamp in heartbeat-state, no alerts needed

## 11:29 manual prefetch test
- After adding `PAGER`/`GOG_PAGER` plus curl timeout + weather fallback, reran `/tmp/prefetch.sh`; all gog commands completed non-interactively and script finished (weather fetch returned no data so fallback logged "Weather data unavailable"). `briefing-data.txt` now up-to-date; ready for upcoming cron run.
