# Weekly Digest: 2026-W07

*Consolidated from 2 daily files on 2026-02-28*

### **Week 2026-W07 Weekly Digest**  
**Key Decisions**  
- Finalized **TakstHjem pitch deck** with hosted HTML link (https://knut.../pitch/index.html) after multiple PDF iteration failures.  
- Approved **"Into the Body" app** MVP using `react-native-body-highlighter` library for anatomical SVGs (chose female model).  
- Launched **AutoCalendar** shared between Knut and BottenAnna for event tracking.  
- Set up **Gmail push notifications** via Pub/Sub and Tailscale Funnel.  

**Important Events**  
- **Andre Gilje** approved TakstHjem MVP landing page (https://knut.../pitch/taksthjem/) and requested deeper Eiendomsverdi analysis.  
- **Martin Knutsen Tran** shared "APP" spec for "Into the Body" and is reviewing the project.  
- **Dag Meltveit** raised concerns about TakstHjem’s data access, moats, and GTM model, requiring further research.  

**Lessons Learned**  
- Avoid hand-drawn SVGs; use libraries like `react-native-body-highlighter` for professional anatomical visuals.  
- Prioritize user feedback: Andre’s request for Eiendomsverdi data supply chain analysis shaped the research scope.  
- Automation wins: Launchd plist ensures pitch server auto-starts, eliminating manual restarts.  

**People/Projects**  
- **Andre Gilje** (TakstHjem, Eiendomsverdi analysis)  
- **Dag Meltveit** (due diligence on TakstHjem)  
- **Martin Knutsen Tran** ("Into the Body" app)  
- **Knut** (technical oversight, calendar management)  

**Unresolved Items**  
- **Pitch server** requires long-term monitoring (though now auto-restarts).  
- **Waitlist form** uses placeholder Formspree; needs real ID.  
- **Eiendomsverdi data research** complete, but Andre requested further validation on data licensing and moats.  
- **Brave Search API** setup (2000 queries/month) needs ongoing tracking.  

**Tools**  
- **Launchd** for pitch server persistence  
- **Tailscale Funnel** for Gmail/Brave API  
- **react-native-body-highlighter** for "Into the Body" UI  

**Next Steps**  
- Finalize Formspree ID for waitlist.  
- Address Dag’s concerns with data licensing and competitive differentiation.  
- Monitor Brave API usage and pitch server stability.
