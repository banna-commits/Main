# 2026-02-25 (Wednesday)

## Mission Control uptime fix
- Rebuilt Next.js app (`npm run build`) and configured LaunchAgent `ai.bottenanna.mission-control` to keep it alive
- Changed runtime port to 3020 after repeated `EADDRINUSE` on 3001, updated `run-prod.sh` + plist
- Verified service via curl and noted further action needed to identify conflicting process on 3001

## Email + Calendar heartbeat
- Inbox has Anthropic + multiple OpenAI billing notices (flagged earlier)
- Ran calendar sweep (primary + AutoCalendar) — several school/lavvo events over Feb 26–27, none within 2h so no alert sent yet

## Late-night heartbeat
- 22:50 email sweep (`newer_than:2h is:unread`) surfaced Bloomberg Fed alerts, OpenAI credit warning, and Anthropic sales follow-up; no direct action needed yet
