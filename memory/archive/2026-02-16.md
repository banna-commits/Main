## Heartbeats (overnight)
- Multiple heartbeat checks 04:15–08:17 AM
- Pitch server: launchd shows "spawn scheduled", exit code 1, but Funnel works fine
- Email checks: no unread
- Calendar checks: no events in next 48h
- All checks logged in heartbeat-state.json

## Dag Meltveit's Response to TakstHjem Pitch
- Dag replied in thread 19c60c4e4f80ddc9 (message ID: 19c63463093c9d50) at 22:47 on Feb 15
- Still marked UNREAD
- Four main concerns:
  1. **Data & regulering** — thinks we underestimate difficulty of Matrikkel/Grunnbok access, "open data" more limited than people think
  2. **Incumbents' moat** — Eiendomsverdi has 20+ years data, bank owners, meglerfeed. Ambita/Virdi/Hjemla already in consumer segment. What's our real differentiation?
  3. **Teknisk gjennomførbarhet** — Without privileged meglerfeed data, how do we match accuracy/latency? Wants benchmarks.
  4. **Go-to-market & inntektsmodell** — Banks/meglerhus locked in, consumers get free valuations from meglere. Who pays and why?
- Asks for concrete research: data sources & license validation, what's available vs needs agreements, differentiation vs incumbents
- Knut said "gjør research og svar begge" — meaning research and reply to both Andre and Dag

## TakstHjem Links
- Knut reported links not working
- Checked: local (127.0.0.1:8890) returns 200, Funnel URL returns 200, HTML content loads fine
- Tailscale Funnel status confirmed: /pitch → 127.0.0.1:8890
- Awaiting Knut's response on what error he sees

## Dag Email Response — SENT ✅
- Split into 2 emails as Knut suggested
- Part 1 (msg 19c66f4515935251): Data Access & Competitive Moats
- Part 2 (msg 19c67047753975c5): Technical Feasibility & Go-to-Market
- Both sent to dag.meltveit@gmail.com, CC knutgreiner@gmail.com + andregilje@hotmail.com
- Thread: 19c60c4e4f80ddc9
- Key points: Kartverket API is free (application-based), consumer-contributed data is our differentiation, target segment is homeowners NOT selling, 990 NOK price point, proposed next steps (API application, benchmark test, paid landing page test)

## Heartbeat → Cron Migration
- Disabled heartbeat polling (was every 30m, blocking main session badly)
- Created cron job "Email & Calendar Check" running at 08, 12, 16, 20 Europe/Oslo
- Runs in isolated session with Sonnet, announces to Telegram only if something needs attention
- Reason: heartbeats were interrupting Knut's conversations with 15-20 min delays

## Response Time Issues
- Knut frustrated with 15-20 min response delays all day
- Root causes: heartbeats blocking session + context filling up (91-92% = 182-184k/200k)
- Messages were queuing while I processed previous responses
- Not a Telegram push issue — messages arrive fine, I'm just slow to process
- Knut requested: /new (fresh session) + update OpenClaw to 2026.2.15

## Morning Briefing Cron — SET UP ✅
- Job ID: 9bf4642a-0919-44c6-b364-51a1c1ec5be2
- Daily at 08:00 Europe/Oslo, Opus, isolated session
- Checks: email (24h unread), calendar, weather, TakstHjem thread
- Agent sends directly to Telegram via message tool (delivery mode=none)
- Lessons: "sonnet" alias not recognized for cron, announce delivery doesn't reach Telegram, need explicit `to` field AND agent must use message tool itself

## Knut's Frameworks & Optimization Guidance
- **1-3-1 Rule** (Dan Martell): Present 1 problem, 3 solutions, 1 recommendation. Adopt for all problem-solving.
- **Optimization tips Knut shared:**
  - Context window guards (<16K block, <32K warn)
  - HyperStack for persistent memory (~350 token cards)
  - Watchdog script for gateway health
  - `openclaw doctor --fix` for silent hangs
  - Model tiering (cheap for heartbeats, expensive for tasks)
  - Reduce background task frequency
  - Prompt caching
  - Explicit "done" rules with commit hash

## ClawHub CLI
- Installed via `npx clawhub` (no global install, needs sudo)
- Slug format: just the skill name, not `author/name`
- PDF skill (seanphan/pdf) flagged as suspicious by VirusTotal — recommended pip install pypdf/pdfplumber instead
- Awaiting Knut's decision

## Git Initialized ✅
- First commit: 34d7644 (BottenAnna, bottenanna26@gmail.com)
- .gitignore: secrets, heartbeat-state.json, node_modules, .expo
- New habits: commit after work, checkpoint before risky ops, one change = one commit

## Evening Session — Setup & Improvements
- Fresh session after update to OpenClaw 2026.2.15
- Set up Morning Briefing cron (job ID: 9bf4642a-0919-44c6-b364-51a1c1ec5be2)
  - Daily 08:00 Europe/Oslo, Opus, isolated session
  - Checks: email, calendar, weather, TakstHjem thread
  - Lessons: "sonnet" alias not recognized for cron, announce delivery doesn't reach Telegram, need explicit `to` field AND agent must use message tool itself
  - Final working config: delivery mode=none, agent sends via message tool directly
- Set up Obsidian vault over workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace`)
  - Created HOME.md dashboard
  - Added wiki-links and tags across all files
- Moved `into-the-body/` → `projects/into-the-body/`
- Discussed knowledge/persistence: already running "poor man's Obsidian" with memory files + semantic search

## Dag's Second Reply (Part 2 response)
- Challenges 990 NOK price — can just call megler and get free valuation
- Likes refinancing bundle idea — suggests Renteradar pairing
- Wants competitor financials besides Eiendomsverdi
- Research done directly (no sub-agent):
  - Ambita: 494M NOK revenue, 62M EBIT (2023)
  - Boligmappa/Hjemla: 59M revenue, -16M result (2024) — free for consumers, losing money
  - Renteradar: free, 250k+ users, partnered with Hjemla
  - Price anchoring: Norwegian digital services cluster 29-149 kr
- Draft reply written, suggesting 49-149 kr or freemium, B2B2C model, Renteradar bundle
- Waiting for Knut's approval before sending

## Sub-Agent Failures
- v1 "Dag TakstHjem Response": used 200k tokens on research, never sent email
- v2 "Dag Reply v2": aborted after 36k tokens due to main session compaction
- Lesson: for email tasks, either do it directly or give sub-agents VERY strict constraints + shorter timeouts
- What worked: writing the email myself directly in main session
